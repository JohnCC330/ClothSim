Cloth Simulation with Finite Element Method(FEM).

Note: this part of project is designed for both Mac and Linux environment.

Compile: Simply type "make".

Run: "./clothSim" will enter the default mode "-0".
	 You could also add a flag to indicate the mode. Ex. "./clothSim -1".

Output: You can output the location and normal of the cloth in an .obj file:
		1. Create a directory named "frames" in the current directory.
		2. Run the program with "./clothSim -w -x", with x being the scene you want to run.
		3. Then every 10th of the frames will be outputed.
		4. If you want to change the nth of frames, you can change "outputFrame" variable in line 36 of the clothSim.cpp file.

		You can output each picture frame:
		1. Create a directory named "images" in the current directory.
		2. While the program is running, push "o" to start output frame, push "o" again to turn the output off. 

A detailed manu is below.
-0: (default) Hung cloth.
-1: Hung cloth with movable ball (use arrow keys to control).
-2: Dropped cloth with air resistance over a ball.
-3: Dropped cloth with air resistance over a cube.
-4: Dropped cloth with air resistance over a table (bit cube).
-5: Dropped cloth with air resistance over a stick (long cube).
-6: Dropped cloth with air resistance on the floor.
